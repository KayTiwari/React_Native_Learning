# React_Native_Learning

Projects so far:

ToDo - Basic Todo app made with RN Expo, fully CRUD.

PokeSearch - Pokemon search engine using axios calls on PokeAPI to list data for user that searches a specific Pokemon.

PokeMap - RN App that has a built in World Map. Includes User auth, and uses a server with MeteorJS on the backend to save and place pokemon images at randomly calculated coordinates. Map currently set to San Francisco.

Firebaseitemlister - Really only did this to learn firebase better, didn't really even complete the app since it was just for fetching and mapping data for firebase.
